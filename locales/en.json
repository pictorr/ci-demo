The fasteners mentioned in the SINIAT materials (e.g. dowel screw, DN6 metal dowel, etc.), including in the written recommendations or in the calculation software, are shown strictly for presentation purposes and may only be used under the above conditions.\n(*3) In the case of fire-resistant or moisture-resistant systems, fibreglass tape must be used. For the other systems, please choose one of the types of jointing tape included in the SINIAT portfolio. Jointing tape will be used for the vertical and horizontal joints of the last layer of plasterboards that was installed.\n(*4)If the upper structure is prone to vertical movements, depending on the installation height of the system, a sliding joint must be executed to ensure that the supporting element can slide unhindered and that no additional loads are placed on the partition element. \n(*5) The plasterboard fastening screws will be placed with an interaxis spacing of 600 mm, vertically, for intermediate plasterboards, and of 300 mm for the last row of plasterboards. Warning! NIDA Profesional jointing plaster will be applied on the vertical and horizontal joints of all the installed plasterboards.\n(*6) The plasterboards will be installed in offset layers to avoid overlapping joints; each successive layer of plasterboards will be offset horizontally by the interaxis distance between two studs, and vertically each row of plasterboards will be offset by at least 400 mm. The size of the plasterboards installed top side must be of at least 400 mm. This offset will also apply between side A and side B as well\n(*7) The vertical stud joints will be offset along the wall, so that they are not on the same horizontal line. The studs can be joined either by overlapping on a minimum length of 500 mm (on either side of the profiles to be joined) using a compatible NIDA Metal UW profile, or by boxing. The joined profiles will be fastened using AP421x9.5/13 self-drilling screws, with a maximum interaxis spacing of 250 mm.\n(*8) As for the door and window openings, the NIDA walls will be configured according to the technical details provided by SINIAT. Frames made of NIDA Metal UA profiles (2 mm thick) will be executed as a simple section or box section, depending on the weight of the panels and the installation height of the walls. For better performance, an independent metallic structure will be dimensioned.\n(*9) Any passages through the fire-resistant NIDA systems (e.g. structural elements, different types of installations, etc.) will be treated using products or systems approved for the same performance level as the NIDA system (e.g. PROMAT).\n(*10) If fire protection is required for the structural elements that will be embedded in the NIDA System walls, a special solution, approved for these elements, will be applied (e.g. NIDA System lining or Promat, PROMAT paint or promat gunite).\n(*11) If the length of the walls exceeds 15 m, expansion joints will be installed at 10-meter intervals and in line with the structural joints of the building.\nFor further details, please contact the SINIAT Technical Department and/or the SINIAT technical approval and/or technical catalogue.",
